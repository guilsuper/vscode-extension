##Features
* Fetches all CSS classes from CSS files on the current workspace (opened folder)
* Fetches all CSS classes from HTML style tags in HTML files on the current workspace [Not implemented yet]
* Option to allow the user to specify directories in which the extension will look for CSS classes [Not implemented yet]

##Usage
The extension starts to fetch for CSS classes on CSS files on your workspace as soon as you open a HTML file for the first time, a notification will be displayed on the top of your editor stating that this process started and as soon as it finishes another notification is displayed stating the end.

As soon as this initial process finishes you're ready to make use of the extension as in the demonstration above.
